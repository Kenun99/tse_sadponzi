# SADPonzi

SADPonzi is a detector for Ponzi scheme smart contracts (ponzitract) base on symbolic execution technology. We implement it atop [teEther](https://github.com/nescio007/teether).

## Benchmark

- Ground Truth Benchmark. We filter the dataset used in https://github.com/blockchain-unica/ethereum-ponzi and get 133 ground truth ponzitracts (see our paper for details). At the meantimes, we collect 1262 DApp as non-Ponzi cases from dapptotal.com. (see [link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq1))
- Robustness Benchark. We generate four groups of data for the robustness experiment. (see [link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq2))
- Large Scale Dataset. We apply SADPonzi to all the 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme smart contracts in total, with a volume of over 17 million US Dollar invested from victims. (see [link](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq3))

## Setup

SADPonzi was tested on an Ubuntu 18.04 server with `Python 3.8.10`. Check the environment requirements of [teEther](https://github.com/nescio007/teether).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Kenun99/tse_sadponzi.git sadponzi && cd sadponzi
$ python3 -m venv ./venv && source ./venv/bin/activate # activate your virtual environment
$ python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt		   # install packages
```

## Run the examples

1. Goto the project folder `sadponzi/`.  
2. Setup a dictionary to save the results. `mkdir ./eval_results`
3. Run RQ1. `python ./effectiveness.py <path_to_RQ1_benchmark> <path_to_results>`. For example, `python ./effectiveness.py /RQ1/ponzi ./eval_results`. Download the RQ1 benchmark from [here](https://github.com/Kenun99/SADPonzi/tree/main/dataset/rq1).
4. Verify the results. If you find False Negatives, please set a larger timeout and run SADPonzi again.
